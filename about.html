				<p> This tracker is a tool with suggestions of what you can eat, but it is not exclusive. Our ancestors had thousands of different foods to choose from. Now we have access to different types of food, but most people eat very little variety.</p>
				<p>You need to eat more than a quarter of a cup in a week to count it towards your 40.</p>
				<p>Different varieties of the same food count towards your 40. For example red apples and green apples count as 2 if you eat more than a 1/4 cup of each.</p>
				<p>Some people may need to avoid certain foods based on their own needs. Feel free to reach out on twitter @nooska44 if you love this idea and would like one made to specific restrictions. This is designed to help, but please note I am not a nutritionist and this and other tools I make are not diet advice.</p>
