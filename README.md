## How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS & JavaScript

This has been the accumulation of much knowledge about gut health and coding. I created the content and design using html & CSS. Used javascript to store checked boxes in local storage, count checkboxes as they were selected and unselected and a reset button to remove data from local storage. 

## Optimizations:
If I had more time I would love to add additional varieties with drop down lists. 

## Lessons Learned:
I was very excited getting the count of the checkboxes to work and saving it into local storage.
